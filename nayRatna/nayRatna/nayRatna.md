GitHub Documents
----------------

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Background
----------

In early 2020-Nov, this [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) messaged his former schoolmates: "Struggling with Portfolio Optimization with an objective of maximizing Net Present Value. Didn't realize optimization was such a hard problem: maximizing (mean) return while also minimizing risk (Extreme Shortfall)". Some friends joked on the understandability. A friend asked if the author was into shares trading and messaged: "I have some. But down by 65%. Bought 6 years back. Sort of stuck. Not getting any positive solutions to mitigate the losses."
