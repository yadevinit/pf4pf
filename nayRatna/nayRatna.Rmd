## Background
In early 2020-Nov, this [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) messaged his former schoolmates: "Struggling with Portfolio Optimization with an objective of maximizing Net Present Value. Didn't realize optimization was such a hard problem: maximizing (mean) return while also minimizing risk (Extreme Shortfall)". Some friends joked on the understandability. A friend asked if the author was into shares trading and messaged: "I have some. But down by 65%. Bought 6 years back. Sort of stuck. Not getting any positive solutions to mitigate the losses."

TBD.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
print("From optimization outputs, generate performance charts and weights")
```
