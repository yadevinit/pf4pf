Here are links to sub-Projects emerging within, listed with the most-recent ones first:
- [Weights to AUM to Invest](./weightsAUMinvest.md).
- [500 invest for 36% CAGR](./invest500CAGR36.md). This is yet to be reduced in size for GitHub to show it. Meanwhile, you could view (and possibly, download 4.4MB of) its PDF [form](./preview-63070e03e9f-500invest36CAGR-2021Jan01-2358.pdf); the code-session outputs and charts are ok to depend on, but beware that its text is yet to be updated to match.
- [Rebalancing Objectives](./rebalanceObjectives.md).
- [Exploring Objectives with R-Optimization Infrastructure (ROI)](./momentObjective.md).
- [Risk-free Nay Ratna](./riskfreeNayRatna.md).
